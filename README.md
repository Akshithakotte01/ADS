 Task Scheduling Simulator using Max Heap

This project is a **C-based Task Scheduling Simulator** that demonstrates
**priority-based task execution** using the **Max Heap data structure**.
The simulator ensures that tasks with the highest priority are executed first,
similar to real-world CPU scheduling systems.

---

  Project Overview
Task scheduling is a fundamental concept in operating systems.
This simulator uses a **Max Heap** to efficiently manage tasks based on their
priority values. It supports dynamic insertion, execution, and display of tasks
while maintaining the heap property throughout execution.

---

 Objectives
- Implement priority-based task scheduling using Max Heap
- Ensure highest-priority task is executed first
- Demonstrate heap operations such as insertion and deletion
- Analyze efficiency compared to linear scheduling methods

---

 Key Features
- Priority-based task scheduling
- Insert tasks with ID, name, and priority
- Execute (delete) the highest-priority task
- Display current task queue
- Efficient operations with **O(log n)** time complexity

---

 Concepts Used
- Max Heap
- Priority Queue
- Heapify (Up and Down)
- Data Structures in C
- CPU Scheduling Principles
